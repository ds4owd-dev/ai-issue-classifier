      "description": "Student needs help or has a question",
      "indicators": ["error", "stuck", "how", "why", "help"],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "assign_users",
          "users": ["massarin", "seawaR", "larnsce"]
        },
        {
          "type": "comment",
          "template": "ðŸ‘‹ **Question Detected**\n\nHi @{{author}}! I've identified this as a question or help request.\n\n**AI Analysis:** {{reasoning}}\n**Confidence:** {{confidence}} âœ…\n\nInstructors have been assigned and will respond soon.\n\n**Need urgent help?** Please reach out via course communication channels."
        },
        {
          "type": "add_labels",
          "labels": ["question", "needs-instructor-review", "ai-processed"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "fallback": {
    "assign_users": ["massarin", "seawaR", "larnsce"],
    "labels": ["needs-manual-review", "ai-failed"],
    "error_template": "ðŸ¤– **AI Classification Failed**\n\nHi @{{author}}! Our AI classifier encountered an issue processing your request.\n\nInstructors have been notified for manual review.\n\n**Sorry for the inconvenience!** Your issue will be handled manually."
  }
}
```

### Available Actions
- `comment`: Post a comment with template
- `add_labels`: Add labels to the issue
- `assign_users`: Assign users to the issue
- `close_issue`: Close the issue
- `notify_users`: Assign users and optionally comment

## How It Works
1. **Action Execution**: Executes configured actions based on classification result
2. **Error Handling**: Falls back to manual review if classification fails
